# Audible Analysis Project

In this project, first cleaned the dataset using Python to ensure its use for the analysis and make good insights from the data. I used Python libraries like pandas, NumPy. Then i made some plots to gain more insights from the data. I used Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries of Python. After these steps i also made a interactive dashboard of the data in which we can see many categories like audiobooks by rating category, audiobooks releases per year and many more.
